# dnnplot
Plot 3d blocks in deep neural networks. Less code, better performance and easier control.

## Note

`dnnplot` does not load `tikz` automatically. You need to load it manully.

## Basic use

Blocksâ€™ placement is arranged as below. And you are suppose to draw blocks from left to right, down to up and back to front, which are posit directions of $x, y,$ and $z$ axes respectly.

The block in dnnplot is a cutomized shape, which means you can use it as a node with lots of anchors and all the styles that can be set for node. The grammar is simple:

```tex
\node[block={<specification>}];
```

where `specification` is a list of `keys/values`.

Here is a primary example (MWE):

```tex
\documentclass[tikz, border=1cm]{standalone}
\usepackage{dnnplot}
\begin{document}
  \tikz \node[block={scale=1, width=30mm, height=30mm, channel=30mm, back plot}] {};
\end{document}
```

We plot a base 3d block. And we use `back plot` option to allow hidden edges to be shown as dashed line.

## Available anchors

A variety of anchors have been defined. They are all shown as below.

## Easy annotation

I define a command to annotate easily:

```tex
\blocklabel[<optional style>]{<node name>}{<edge specification>}{<text>}
```

- `<node name>`: specifed when you declare a node such as `\node (a) {};` then the `node name` is `a`.

- `<edge specification>`: specify the edge to which the labe are attached. Available `edge specifications` such as `upperright` are shown in the figure below. If you pass a undefined specification, nothing will happen.

- `<text>`: text to be shown in the node.

- `<optional style>`: all the arguments are passed to the text node. If it is empty, default position of the label are set.  Options like `near start` also work.
**Note: no semicolon is needed in this command!**

## Alignment

If you draw a block `(a)`, and then a block `(b)` using `right=3cm of a` option in tikzlibrary `positioning`,  by default `(a)` and `(b)` are central aligned in $x$ axis of the $3d$ space.

Primarily, I have implement the basic alignment in $x$ axis by setting

```
block={pre=<node name>, align=<align specification}
```

in node option.

- `<node name>`: name of the defined node.
- `<align specification>`: specify the style of the alignment. Now it supports `xleft, xright, xup, xdown`, which means applying alignment along the corresponding edge of previous node.
  **Note: if a wrong node name or specification is passed, the block is drawn in situ.**

## Options of block shape

- `width`: width of the block, default 1cm.
- `height`: width of the block, default 1cm.
- `channel`: number of channels of the block, default 1cm.
- `scale`: apply a scaling to the shape, default 0.5.
- `pre`: name of the previous node, used for shifting and alignment.
- `align`: specify the style of the alignment.
- `back plot`: if this option are used, hidden edges are drawn as dashed lines.

## To be added...

1. Shifting in $z$ axis
2. Arbitrary alignment
